# Ping_pong_game_RTOS
The classic ping pong game, running on ESP32 with FreeRTOS.
This code was designed, written, and tested by Neil Vel√°squez.
It works for ESP32 microcontrollers.
This version considers its operation with:
- 16x15 LED matrix, meaning 465 WS2812b Neopixel LEDs.
- - 2 potentiometers of 10 kOhms.
- A 3A power supply.
- Of course, an ESP32 Wroom 32 development board.
- 
Other functions will be added over the coming days.
